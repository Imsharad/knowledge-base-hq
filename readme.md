If your `main.py` file depends on the [firecrawl-py](file:///Users/sharadjain/github%20workspaces#1%2C64-1%2C64) package or any other packages that you installed in your virtual environment, you should remain in the virtual environment to run your `main.py` file. This ensures that Python uses the correct versions of the packages that are installed in the virtual environment, rather than any globally installed packages.

### Running Your `main.py` File in the Virtual Environment

1. **Ensure the virtual environment is activated**:
   If your terminal prompt shows [(myvenv)](file:///Users/sharadjain/github%20workspaces#3%2C70-3%2C70), you are still in the virtual environment. If not, you can reactivate it with:
   ```bash
   source ~/myvenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run your Python script**:
   While in the virtual environment, navigate to the directory containing your `main.py` file (if you are not already there) and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Exiting the Virtual Environment

After you have finished running your Python scripts that depend on the virtual environment, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:
```bash
deactivate
```
This command will return you to the system's default Python environment.

### Summary

- **Stay in the virtual environment** to run Python scripts that depend on packages installed within it.
- **Exit the virtual environment** when you are done to return to your systemâ€™s default settings.

This approach helps manage package dependencies effectively, especially when different projects require different versions of packages.
